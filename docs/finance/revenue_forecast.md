## Overview

This document outlines our revenue forecasting methodology, which combines historical trend analysis, sales pipeline data, and market indicators to produce reliable projections.

## Forecasting Process

1. **Historical Analysis**

   - Review past 8 quarters of revenue data
   - Identify seasonal patterns
   - Calculate baseline growth rate

2. **Pipeline Analysis**

   - Evaluate current sales pipeline
   - Apply probability factors based on stage
   - Project conversion timeline

3. **Market Adjustment**

   - Estimate revenue from new features
   - Project upgrade rates for existing customers
   - Calculate expansion revenue

## Calculation Method

Monthly Revenue Forecast = (Baseline Revenue × Growth Factor) + (Pipeline Conversion) + (Expansion Revenue) ± (Market Adjustments)

## Reporting Cadence
