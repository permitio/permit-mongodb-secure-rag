# System Architecture

## Overview

Our system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following key components:

1. **Frontend Layer**

   - React-based SPA
   - Server-side rendering for initial load
   - Redux for state management

2. **API Layer**

   - RESTful APIs built with FastAPI
   - GraphQL for complex data queries
   - API Gateway for routing and authentication

3. **Service Layer**

   - User Service
   - Content Service
   - Analytics Service
   - Notification Service

4. **Data Layer**

   - PostgreSQL for relational data
   - MongoDB for document storage
   - Redis for caching
   - Elasticsearch for search

5. **Infrastructure**
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - AWS as primary cloud provider
   - Terraform for infrastructure as code
   - Prometheus for monitoring

## Security Measures

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular security audits
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Deployment Process

1. CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
2. Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
3. Blue/green deployment strategy
4. Canary releases for new features
